<h1>InIt</h1>
<h2>We are InIt for you</h2>
<p>This is a social charity website aimed at connecting different NGOs, old-age homes, orphanages and other social organizations with individuals who wish to bring about a change in society.Only the front-end has been created consisting of a login page, a landing page and an about us section. Click on the continue button to navigate from the login page (since I have started learning backend just now :(  ). Three different cards are there on the login page which provide options to the user. I plan to extend this project further as I keep learning. The idea is that different organizations which are registered with InIt (I plan to extend the Register with us link on the navbar too) can request things according to their requirements and this will be reflected on the 'Give Back to Society' page where willful individuals may donate or contribute. The Join a Movement page will feature movements or campaigns (such as cleanliness campaigns, tree planting campaigns etc.) taking place in the user's community which he/she may join or maybe create a new movement. The 'InIt Good Samaritan' is a paid feature which busy individuals may  opt for, they entrust us with their money with which we then fund the social organizations. This is the crux of my idea which I plan to implement as I learn.  </p>
